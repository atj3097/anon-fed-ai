# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

This project implements a privacy-preserving federated learning system that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. We use techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC) or homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of the data while still allowing the model to learn from it.

## Features

1. Minimal web-based user interface for data upload and training initiation
2. Client module for encrypting data, training local models, and generating zk-SNARK proofs
3. Smart contract module for aggregating model updates, verifying proofs, and sharing global model
4. Communication layer for secure data transmission between clients and the smart contract
5. Blockchain integration for consensus on the choice of the machine learning model

# Project Phases
## Phase 1: Planning and Design

- Define the scope and requirements of the project in detail.
- Identify the technologies and tools to be used for each component.
- Design the system architecture and interactions between microservices.
- Create a detailed project plan with milestones and deadlines.
- Define user stories and create a product backlog.

## Phase 2: Development Environment Setup
- Set up the development environment for each microservice.
- Configure version control (e.g., Git) and project management tools (e.g., Jira or Trello).
- Set up containerization and orchestration tools (e.g., Docker and Kubernetes).
- Establish coding standards, guidelines, and workflows.

## Phase 3: User Interface Service Development

- Design the user interface and user experience (UI/UX).
- Implement the frontend using React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Set up API calls to communicate with the Client Module Service.
- Test the User Interface Service.

## Phase 4: Client Module Service Development

- Implement data encryption using PySyft or PySEAL.
- Implement local model training using TensorFlow Federated or PySyft.
- Implement zk-SNARK proof generation using libsnark, bellman, or zokrates.
- Develop APIs for the frontend to consume these functionalities.
- Test the Client Module Service.

## Phase 5: Smart Contract Service Development

Develop the Ethereum smart contract for model aggregation, proof verification, and model sharing.
Implement IPFS integration for decentralized storage of the global model.
Test the Smart Contract Service.
Phase 6: Communication Service Development

Implement a secure communication protocol (HTTPS with TLS/SSL) for data transmission between clients and the smart contract.
Test the Communication Service.
Phase 7: Integration and Testing

Integrate all microservices and ensure seamless communication between them.
Conduct end-to-end testing, including unit, integration, and system tests.
Perform load and stress testing to ensure the system's reliability and performance.
Resolve bugs and issues discovered during testing.
Phase 8: Deployment and Monitoring

Deploy the microservices to production using containerization and orchestration tools.
Set up monitoring and logging tools to track the system's performance and health.
Continuously monitor the system and address issues as they arise.
Phase 9: Documentation and Maintenance

Document the system architecture, design, and implementation details.
Provide user guides and API documentation.
Maintain the system by addressing bugs, improving performance, and updating dependencies as needed.
