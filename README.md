# Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning

This project implements a privacy-preserving federated learning system that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their raw data. We use techniques such as secure multi-party computation (SMPC) or homomorphic encryption to protect the privacy of the data while still allowing the model to learn from it.

## Features

1. Minimal web-based user interface for data upload and training initiation
2. Client module for encrypting data, training local models, and generating zk-SNARK proofs
3. Smart contract module for aggregating model updates, verifying proofs, and sharing global model
4. Communication layer for secure data transmission between clients and the smart contract
5. Blockchain integration for consensus on the choice of the machine learning model

## Technologies

- Frontend: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Encryption: PySyft, PySEAL
- Federated Learning: TensorFlow Federated, PySyft
- zk-SNARK Proofs: libsnark, bellman, zokrates
- Blockchain: Ethereum, Smart Contracts
- Decentralized Storage: IPFS

## System Architecture

Here's an overview of the system architecture, with each component as a separate microservice:

### User Interface Service (Frontend)
- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML and CSS: Standard technologies for structuring and styling web pages.
- JavaScript (or TypeScript): Programming language for implementing client-side logic.

### Client Module Service
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- Express: A lightweight web framework for Node.js to create APIs.
- PySyft or PySEAL: Libraries for implementing secure multi-party computation or homomorphic encryption.
- TensorFlow Federated or PySyft: Libraries for federated learning and training local machine learning models on encrypted data.
- libsnark, bellman, or zokrates: Libraries for implementing zk-SNARK proofs.

### Smart Contract Service
- Ethereum: A decentralized blockchain platform for building smart contracts.
- Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform.
- Truffle: A development framework for building, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- Ganache: A local Ethereum blockchain for development and testing.
- IPFS: A decentralized storage system for storing the encrypted global model.

### Communication Service
- HTTPS with TLS/SSL: A secure communication protocol for transmitting data between clients and the smart contract.

The microservices will communicate with each other using well-defined APIs and JSON data structures. They will be loosely coupled, allowing each service to evolve independently and be deployed, scaled, or updated without affecting other services.

## Functional Requirements:

- Users should be able to upload their preprocessed data through a web-based interface.
- The system should encrypt the preprocessed data using an existing encryption library (e.g., PySyft or PySEAL).
- A local machine learning model should be trained on the encrypted data using an existing federated learning library (e.g., TensorFlow Federated or PySyft).
- The system should generate zk-SNARK proofs that attest to the correctness of the local model updates without revealing the underlying data.
- A smart contract on a blockchain platform (e.g., Ethereum) should be implemented to aggregate model updates, verify zk-SNARK proofs, and share the global model.
- The system should verify submitted zk-SNARK proofs to ensure the correctness of users' model updates.
- The smart contract should calculate the average update from users' model updates to create the global model.
- The global model should be encrypted and stored on a decentralized storage system (e.g., IPFS), with the IPFS hash saved in the smart contract.
- Users should be able to retrieve the IPFS hash from the smart contract and download the encrypted global model from IPFS using the hash.
- Secure data transmission between clients and the smart contract should be facilitated using a simple communication protocol (e.g., HTTPS with TLS/SSL).
- The system should integrate blockchain technology to facilitate consensus on the choice of the machine learning model.
- A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) should be created for users to vote on the machine learning model to be used for training. Once a majority vote is reached, the smart contract should trigger the start of the federated learning process.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

- Scalability: The system should be able to handle a large number of users and accommodate increasing data and computational loads.
- Performance: The system should have low latency and fast response times for user interactions and data processing.
- Security: The system should ensure data privacy and protect against unauthorized access and attacks.
- Reliability: The system should have high availability and recover gracefully from failures.
- Maintainability: The system should be modular and well-documented, allowing for easy updates and maintenance.
